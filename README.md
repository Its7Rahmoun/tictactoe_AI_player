<h&>Tic Tac Toe AI Player with AlphaGo Algorithm</h1>
Overview
This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game with an AI player that utilizes the AlphaGo algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). The AI is designed not only to simulate human actions but also to learn and improve its gameplay over time, eventually achieving a level where it can consistently win against a human player.

Features
Tic Tac Toe Game: Play the classic Tic Tac Toe game against an intelligent AI opponent.
AlphaGo Algorithm: The AI player is powered by the AlphaGo algorithm, a sophisticated RL approach that allows the AI to learn from its interactions and adapt its strategy over multiple gameplays.
Simulation of Human Actions: The AI is designed to mimic human-like moves, providing a more engaging and realistic gaming experience.
Adaptive Learning: The AI continuously learns and refines its strategy based on the outcomes of previous games. This ensures that it becomes progressively more challenging and skilled.
